# CroudFunding-Solidity

1) The admin will start a campaign for CroudFunding with a specific monetary goal and deadline
2) contributors will contribute to that project by sending ETH
3) the admin has to create a spending Request to spend money for the campaign
4) Once the spending request was created the Contributers can start voting for that specific spending request
5) if more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request then the admin would have the permission to spend the amount specific in the spending request
6) The power is moved from the campaign's admin to those that donated money
7) the contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the deadline
